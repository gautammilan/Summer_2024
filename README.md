Completed Tasks:
1. Left-to-right MFE folding.
2. Left-to-right Inside.
3. Left-to-right Inside in log-space.
4. Right-to-left Outside in log-space: Verified that Q_1,0==Q1,n.
Let's think of each span in the sequence as a vertex "v". The reason behind Q_1,0 being equal to Q1,n is that all structures for span 1,n decompose into vertex 1,0 as the terminal node. Thus, Q_1,0 equals the sum of the energies of all
structures that decompose to vertex v for the span from 1 to 0, which is equivalent to the sum of all the energy structures given by the partition function Q1,n. Hence, Q_1,0 equals Q1,n.

5. Base-pairing probabilities: Verified when T close to 0 (i,j) belongs to MFE, then pij is close to 1.

6. stochastic sampling: Verified
